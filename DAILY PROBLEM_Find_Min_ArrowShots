==============================
One way to solve this problem is to sort the 
points by their start coordinate and then iterate
 through the sorted points, shooting an arrow whenever 
the start coordinate of the current point is greater than
 the end coordinate of the previous point. This approach
 has a time complexity of O(n log n),
 where n is the number of points.
