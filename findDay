import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Solution {
    public static String findDay(int month, int day, int year) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(year, month, day);
        return date.getDayOfWeek().toString();
    }
}

Explanation:
We can use the LocalDate class in Java 8's java.time package to easily get the day of the week for a given date.
We create a LocalDate object with the given year, month, and day, and then call its getDayOfWeek() method to get the corresponding DayOfWeek enum value. 
Finally, we convert this enum value to a string 
using the toString() method and return it as the result of the findDay function.
